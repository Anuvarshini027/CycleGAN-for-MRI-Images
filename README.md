# CycleGAN-for-MRI-Images

There are two main types of MRI images, T1-weighted MRI and T2-weighted MRI images. Both types of MRI contrast different regions within the body.</br>
T1-weighted images specifically highlight fat tissue, while T2-weighted images highlight both fat and water within the body.</br>
T1-weighted → fat issue appear to be bright</br>
T2-weighted → both fat and water regions appear to be bright</br>
